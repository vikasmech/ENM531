Consult the Web for instructions and make sure you have the following software properly installed and working on your laptop:
- A Python 3 distribution configured for scientific computing. The simplest way to set this up is by installing the [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python) distribution.
- [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax#installation). Composable transformations of Python+NumPy programs: differentiate, vectorize, JIT to GPU/TPUs, and more.
- [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/). You will need this in order to follow some of the in-class tutorials.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). You will need this in order to download and stay in sync with the latest code we will develop in class.
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). Sign in with your Penn Gmail account. Provides free access to GPU and TPU cloud computing resources.
