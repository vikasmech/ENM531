<p>It is a serious ethical violation to take any material created by another person and represent it as your own original work. Plagiarism may involve copying text from a book, journal article or online blog without attributing the source, or lifting words, code, figures, videos, or other materials from the internet and attempting to pass them off as your own. Please ask the instructor if you have any questions about how to distinguish between acceptable research and plagiarism.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re repurposing code, be sure to keep the original licensing intact.</p>

<p>When in doubt: ask.</p>
