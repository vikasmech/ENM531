        <h4 class="f2 fw3 lh-title dib dark-grey">Exercise</h4>
        <p>Read and use the materials in the Excel basics tutorial 1 to complete the following tasks.</p>
        <p>Open the massshootings_us_2016_2013 sheet. This contains a list of mass shooting reported in the United States since January 1st, 2013 until June 13, 2016, collected by the Gun Violence Archive from public reports.</p>
        <p>Do the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Set width.</li>
            <li>Freeze your headers.</li>
            <li>Check the Dates in column A. If the dates are not all stored as dates, change to date format.</li>
            <li>Add filters to filter data by A to Z in State and find out which State had more incidents in total and more killings in total?</li>
            <li>Cancel filters</li>
            <li>Add sort to sort values by # Killed largest to smallest and sort values by #Injured from largest to smallest.</li> Can you tell us which are the top 10 largest Killed numbers and the top 10 largest Injured numbers?</li>
            <li>Cancel filters and sorting.</li>
            <li>Using formulas find out how many people have been killed and how many have been injured in total and per year?</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Now answer the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>What was the average of people killed in mass shootings in total and per year?</li>
            <li>What was the median of people killed in mass shootings in total and per year?</li>
            <li>What was the mode (most common value) of people killed in mass shootings in total and per year?</li>
            <li>Use the Min and Max functions and Sort options to identify largest and smallest amount of people killed in one single mass shooting.</li>
            <li>Can you calculate what percentage is the largest killing, of all killings of the period 2013-2016?</li>
          </ol>
        <p>Now use the CONCATENATE function to join the address of every single incident in to a new column. Your goal here is to get the address that is currently separated in columns State, City Or County, Address into a new column where the data should be organized like this Address, City or County, State.</p>
        <p>Now open the sheet killed_2016_2013 and try the following percentage exercises:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If X amount of people were injured in Mass Shootings in the US in the period 2013 to 2016, and Y amount of people were injured in 2015. What percentage is the 2015 injured of the total period 2013 to 2016?</li>
            <li>If X amount of people were injured in Mass Shootings in the US in 2015 and Y amount of people were injured in 2014. How did it change in percentage up or down?</li>
          </ul>
